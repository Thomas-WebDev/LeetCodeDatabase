# 262. Trips and Users

# Calulate number of canceled requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users

# Logic chain is...
# Get number of canceled requests made by unbanned users
#  if the driver is not banned
#   if Request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"
#    if status does not equal ENUM 'completed'
# Get total number of requests made by unbanned users
