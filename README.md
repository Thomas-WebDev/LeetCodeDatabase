This is a collection of my submissions to LeetCode Database problems in MySql. 

I will probably back track and write them up in MS SQL and maybe as Oracle queries (I donâ€™t currently know how to do this) but as a reference for anyone who is starting out as a Database Developer or Analyst, this should give you the solutions to the free problems if you get stuck. 
My advise is not to look at these if you have not solved the problems first. 

You get a lot more out of it if you work through the logic on your own and these logic puzzles are fun.
